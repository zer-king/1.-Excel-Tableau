# 1.-Excel-Tableau
## Wealth of Nations Data Visualization Project

### Summary

This project uses the Wealth of Nations Excel dataset to create data visualizations in Tableau. The dataset includes data on GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth, and smartphone users worldwide. The data was cleaned, formatted, and filtered in Excel before being imported into Tableau.

### Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard includes a variety of visualizations that explore the relationships between the different variables in the dataset. Some of the key findings include:

* There is a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy at birth.
* Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have more smartphone users.
* However, there are some exceptions to these trends. For example, some countries with relatively low GDP per capita have high life expectancy at birth.

### Conclusion

The Tableau dashboard provides a valuable tool for exploring and understanding the data on wealth, health, and technology from around the world.
